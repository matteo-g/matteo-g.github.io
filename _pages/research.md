Within Economics, my research focuses mostly on **political economy**,
**development economics**, and **behavioral economics**. I employ
state-of-the-art AI and NLP pipelines to extract and analyse data from
natural language, to understand how narratives, beliefs, and social norms
affect economic behavior. I planned and led numerous A/B tests, online
experiments, and field experiments, in both high- and low-income countries.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <p>Zero-sum thinking and oppositional identities pose essential threats to
    democracies and their ability to conduct mutually beneficial reforms. Zero-sum
    narratives contribute to this problem, but can aspirational narratives also be
    part of the solution? We test this conjecture in the context of a surprising
    and highly contentious political decision that forced society and politics to
    decide within a limited time frame on a particularly polarized issue: the future
    of artisanal gold mining in the Peruvian Amazon. We conducted a competition
    among professional filmmakers to create an aspirational narrative video treatment
    portraying a possible mutually beneficial future with cleaner and more formalized
    mining. We then use this video as a treatment, and run a pre-registered experiment
    with 400 participants in two major Peruvian cities. Compared to a passive control
    group, the narrative video significantly shifts beliefs about miners from being
    clear villains to possible heroes. We find that this not only shifts beliefs and
    expectations, but also real-stakes outcomes: Treatment participants are about 15%
    more likely to sign a letter supporting mutually beneficial reforms. We highlight
    a decrease in zero-sum thinking and a change in in- vs. out-group identity as two
    main mechanisms.</p>

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <p>Narratives significantly shape economic and political decision-making
    processes, yet understanding their causal impact remains a critical challenge.
    This paper investigates the influence of narratives on economic choices,
    specifically within the context of environmentally sustainable mining in the
    Peruvian Amazon. We focus on how weaving information on clean technology into
    narratives affects artisanal miners' decisions. The study contrasts groups of
    miners receiving information embedded in an aspirational narrative against a
    control group that receives information in a factual manner. Our study aims to
    provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of narratives in policy
    settings.</p>

  <details class="paper-abstract">
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <p>Does populist rhetoric merely exploit existing social divisions, or does it
    actively reshape political discourse? We study this question by exploiting the
    sudden rise of Donald Trump during the 2016 US presidential campaign as a natural
    experiment. Using a comprehensive dataset of over 1 million Twitter posts from
    2010–2021 and a difference-in-differences design comparing the US to other
    English-speaking democracies, we show that Trump's nomination caused a significant
    increase in villain narratives — a defining feature of populist communication that
    casts political opponents, institutions, and media as enemies rather than legitimate
    adversaries. Focusing on climate change discourse to isolate narrative effects from
    real-world events, we find that villain narratives increased by 6 percentage points
    following Trump's May 2016 nomination. We document heterogeneous effects across
    Republicans, Democrats, and Independents, suggesting that the effect operates
    through social learning and strategic adaptation, not just mobilization of existing
    grievances.</p>

  <div class="paper-title">Virality: What Makes Narratives Go Viral and Does it Matter?</div>
  <div class="paper-meta">with Kai Gehring · 2025</div>
  <details class="paper-abstract">
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <p>The effectiveness of political narratives as a communication technology
    depends on their virality and on the persuasiveness of single narrative
    exposure. To analyze narratives empirically, we introduce the political
    narrative framework and a pipeline for its measurement using large language
    models (LLMs). The framework captures the essence of a narrative by its
    characters, who are either neutral or cast in one of three drama triangle
    roles: hero, villain, or victim. Using 1.15 million U.S. climate policy
    tweets from 2010–2021, we find that political narratives are consistently
    more viral than comparable neutral tweets. This result is robust to
    conditioning on a rich set of fixed effects, author characteristics, language
    metrics and emotionality. Hero roles increase virality by 56%, but the biggest
    virality boost stems from using villain roles (152%) and from combining other
    roles with villain characters. To examine the persuasiveness of single exposure
    to some of the most frequent and viral character-role combinations, we use
    three pre-registered online experiments with 3000 participants. The results
    show that narrative exposure influences beliefs and revealed preferences about
    a character, while a single exposure is not sufficient to move support for
    specific policies. Political narratives also lead to consistently higher memory
    of the narrative characters and their roles, while memory of objective facts is
    not improved. Taken together, the political narrative framework provides a
    measure that moves beyond emotions and linguistic features, helps to explain
    virality, and is linked to shifts in beliefs, revealed preferences, and
    memory.</p>

  <div class="paper-meta">with Marcel Caesmann, Lorenz Gschwent · 2025</div>
  <details class="paper-abstract">
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <p>The spread of propaganda and misinformation from autocratic regimes is a
    growing concern in democracies. We study the European Union's ban on Russian
    state-backed news outlets after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, analyzing
    677,780 tweets from 146,633 users with a difference-in-differences design in
    a daily panel. The ban reduced pro-Russian tweets by 10.9% per active user
    day, with strongest effects among users directly connected to the banned
    outlets. We find no evidence of substitution to secondary suppliers. Evidence
    on mechanisms indicates that the ban curtailed pro-Russian content by removing
    key agenda-setters. Finally, we examine the costs of censorship in a democratic
    context: A pre-registered experiment finds reduced satisfaction with free
    speech, particularly among political centrists.</p>
