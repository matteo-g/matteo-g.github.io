    <p class="home-role">Post Doc Researcher in Political Economy</p>
    <p>
      Welcome to my personal website! I am a Post Doc researcher in Political
      Economy at the <em>Wyss Academy for Nature at the University of Bern</em>.
      The Wyss Academy for Nature is an interdisciplinary organization with
      global reach. Its mission is to transform scientific knowledge into action
      to address the climate and environmental crises. I obtained my MSc in
      Economics from the University of Pisa and Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna.
      I have experience as a researcher in several institutions and universities,
      including the European Commission Joint Research Center and the University
      of Zurich.

      My primary research focus lies at the intersection of political economy,
      public economics and development economics. My research aims to address
      meaningful economic questions, underscoring the role of narratives,
      societal norms, and historical context in shaping economic behavior.
      In my work, I employ advanced methodologies, in particular from the
      Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning toolkits. My current
      research projects span across diverse strands of the economic literature
      including: narrative economics, climate change policy, censorship in
      democracy, and social norms.
