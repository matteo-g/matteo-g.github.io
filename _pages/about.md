    <p class="home-role">Post Doc Researcher in Political Economy</p>
    <p>
      Welcome to my personal website! I am a Post Doc researcher in Political
      Economy at the <em>Wyss Academy for Nature at the University of Bern</em>.
      I earned my PhD in Economics at the <strong>University of Bern</strong>,
      where I was advised by <strong>Kai Gehring</strong> (UniBern) and
      <strong>Costanza Naguib</strong> (UniBern). My thesis was reviewed by
      <strong>Elliott Ash</strong> (ETH). Prior to my PhD I gained experience
      in research and policy evaluation at institutions including the University
      of Zurich, Harvard Business School, and the European Commission Joint
      Research Center.
