I manage large projects from early scoping to final delivery. My work spans
high-income contexts as well as low- and middle-income countries (LMICs),
where I have led and co-led field experiments and national survey operations.
I also run laboratory experiments with university students and build
end-to-end pipelines for online surveys — covering instrument design,
implementation, quality control, documentation, and handover. Below two
leading examples.

## Narrative Intervention: A Large Field Experiment in the Peruvian Amazon

**Role:** Project Lead &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Period:** 2024–2026 &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Context:** Gold Mining

Conceived during a field visit to the Peruvian Amazon, this project tested an
innovative behavioral intervention to nudge miners toward better practices in
a setting where policy tools and enforcement had repeatedly fallen short. Using
movies that changed the narrative about artisanal miners from framing them as
villains to picturing potential heroes, we provided a different pathway to
bring change.

I developed the project from zero to a fundable proposal, secured an internal
investment of roughly USD 150–200k, and then co-led it through implementation.
Delivery required coordination across teams based in the US, Switzerland, and
Peru, with tight management of logistics, field operations, and partner
communication.

Data collection combined standard survey operations with an unconventional
field strategy: a first-time football tournament organized in the jungle to
support recruitment and participation. The effort generated roughly 400 survey
responses and established the operational backbone for fieldwork in a
hard-to-reach context.

## Changing Policy Preferences and Beliefs: Laboratory Experiment

**Role:** Co-Lead &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Period:** 2025–2026 &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Context:** Public Reform

This project supported the design and implementation of a digital-twin
technology for a large area in central Kenya, with a focus on improving
carbon offset estimation and strengthening fair benefit-sharing approaches.

As a collaborator, the work combined technical project development with
on-the-ground coordination in Kenya. Stakeholder engagement was a core
component: collaboration with local leaders, officials, businesses, and NGOs
helped deliver a workshop series with 50+ participants in a very diverse and
complicated landscape.

A major output was the design of a $350k contract to develop a Monitoring,
Reporting and Verification (MRV) system. This included defining indicators,
data requirements, and reporting outputs to track environmental risks such as
wildfires, poaching, drought, and land-use change.
